2. Tweeter
Alright, you’re mostly on your own for this. You can do it =]
Here is what should go inside your Tweeter module:
An array of posts - this should be private. Use the dummy data below to get started
A variable postIdCounter to count the number of total posts
A variable commentIdCounter to count the number of total comments
A getPosts function that returns the posts array
An addPost function that receives some text and adds a post object to posts
Each object should have three properties: id, text, and comments
You should generate the next id correctly for each post: "p4", "p5", …
The comments array should be empty initially
A removePost function that receives a postID and removes the relevant post from posts
Stop here
Make sure everything works. Then keeping coding
An addComment function that receives a postID and text. 
It should push an object to the relevant post’s comments array
The object should have two properties: text and id - this is the comment’s ID
You should generate the next id correctly for each comment:"c7", "c8", …
A removeComment function that receives a postID and a commentID - you understand what it should do
